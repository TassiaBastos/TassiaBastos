# Tássia Laís Barros Bastos

### Hi there 👋
I am passionate about solving problems using programming.
I'm a FullStack developer and a lover of bioinformatics :computer:

- 🔭 I am currently working on bioinformatics, more precisely studying how to apply the treatment of incomplete kernels in bipartite networks in the prediction of interactions in biological networks. Within this context, I developed python and R projects, and if you want to know more about them, ask me! 😊
I am currently working as well mentoring and helping young startups to growing their projects using and applying the concepts of design thinking.

- 🌱 I am currently learning more about web development, improving my knowledge in technologies like CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, NodeJS ...

- :high_brightness: I'm looking to collaborate on front-end projects and help people to know and using Design Thinking in their projects.
