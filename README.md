# Tássia Laís Barros Bastos

### Hi there 👋
I am a Software Engineer who loves solving problems and building good programs. I appreciate using my time to understand why and how things work, therefore, I'm always learning new things and I try to put them into use in my personal and professional projects. In a nutshell, I am a Front-End developer and a lover of bioinformatics :computer:

A little more of my trajectory:

- 🌱 I started my career as a Biomedic, but I have always admired the power that technology has in all segments of the business industry. This was definitely one of the main reasons for my career change. Having worked with bioinformatics I developed Python and R projects to study how to apply the treatment of incomplete kernels in bipartite networks in the prediction of interactions in biological networks.

- 🌱 As a software developer, I am also skilled at web development with more traditional technologies such as: CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, NodeJS, React, PNP and others. I am currently working as a SharePoint developer, exploring Microsoft's web application platform. With SharePoint I am able to create corporate portals and intranets, manage content and documents, create collaborative portals and much more.

- :high_brightness: I try to collaborate on front-end projects and help people to know and use Design Thinking in their projects.

Do not hesitate to contact me for more information and to share knowledge.
